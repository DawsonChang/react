# Streamy
> This app provides a platform where users could live broadcast their videos and viewers could watch them at the same time. The idea is from Twitch. I tried to mimic the main function of Twitch in a clean and simple way by react/redux during the online course of react.

### client
The main app biilt by react/redux structure

### api
A seperate app serves a small database which may save the created stream

### rtmpserver
A seperate app which may provide node-media-server for video stream
